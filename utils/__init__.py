 Here is a simple, production-ready `utils/__init__.py` module in Python:
```
# utils/__init__.py

def hello\_world():
    """
    Prints a friendly greeting.

    :return: None
    """
    print("Hello, world!")

def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculates the factorial of a number.

    :param n: The number to calculate the factorial of.
    :type n: int
    :return: The factorial of the number.
    :rtype: int
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This code will only run if the module is run directly,
    # not if it is imported.

    # Print a friendly greeting.
    hello_world()

    # Calculate the factorial of a number.
    num = 5
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}")
```
This module includes two functions: `hello_world`, which prints a friendly greeting, and `factorial`, which calculates the factorial of a number. It also includes a main guard, which allows the module to be run directly or imported as a module.
