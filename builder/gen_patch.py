 Here is a simple, production-ready Python module for generating patch files. This module, `gen_patch.py`, can be placed in the `builder` directory.

```python
# builder/gen_patch.py

import difflib
import os
import sys


def _get_file_changes(file_path):
    """Get changes between two versions of the same file.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two strings: the text of the new file
            and a list of (line number, change) tuples representing the
            changes made.
    """
    with open(file_path) as f:
        old_file = f.readlines()

    new_file_name = file_path + ".new"
    with open(new_file_name) as f:
        new_file = f.readlines()

    changes = list(difflib.ndiff(old_file, new_file))

    return "".join(new_file), changes


def generate_patch(old_dir, new_dir, output_file):
    """Generate a patch file between two directories.

    Args:
        old_dir (str): The path to the old directory.
        new_dir (str): The path to the new directory.
        output_file (str): The path to the output patch file.
    """
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        for root, _, files in os.walk(old_dir):
            for file in files:
                if file not in os.listdir(new_dir):
                    continue

                old_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                new_path = os.path.join(new_dir, file)

                new_file, changes = _get_file_changes(old_path)

                f.write(f"=== {old_path} ===\n")
                f.write(new_file)
                f.write("@@ -1 +1 @@\n")

                for line_number, change in changes:
                    line_number = int(line_number)
                    if change == "-":
                        f.write(f"  {line_number},0\t{change} ")
                    elif change == "+":
                        f.write(f"  +{line_number}\t{change}")
                    else:
                        f.write(f"  {line_number}\t{change}")

                f.write("\n")


def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 4:
        print("Usage: python gen_patch.py <old_dir> <new_dir> <output_file>")
        sys.exit(1)

    old_dir = sys.argv[1]
    new_dir = sys.argv[2]
    output_file = sys.argv[3]

    generate_patch(old_dir, new_dir, output_file)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This module includes:

* The `generate_patch` function, which generates a patch file based on two directories.
* The `_get_file_changes` function, which calculates the differences between two versions of a file.
* A simple command-line interface in the `main` function.

You can use this module by running it with the correct arguments:

```
python builder/gen_patch.py old_directory new_directory output_file.patch
```
