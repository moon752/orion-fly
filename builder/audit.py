 Here is a simple Python module for auditing files in a directory. This module provides a function for auditing all files in a directory and printing the results to the console. It includes docstrings and a main guard.

```python
"""Module for auditing files in a directory.

This module provides a function for auditing all files in a directory and
printing the results to the console.
"""

import os

def audit_directory(directory):
    """Audit all files in the given directory.

    This function will audit all files in the given directory by printing
    the name of each file and its size in bytes to the console. If the
    directory does not exist, a FileNotFoundError will be raised.

    Args:
        directory (str): The path to the directory to be audited.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the directory does not exist.

    """
    if not os.path.isdir(directory):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Directory '{directory}' not found.")

    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            print(f"{file_path}: {os.path.getsize(file_path)} bytes")

def main():
    """Entry point for the module.

    This function is the entry point for the module. It will audit the
    current working directory by default, or a different directory if
    provided as a command line argument.

    """
    import sys

    directory = "./" if len(sys.argv) == 1 else sys.argv[1]
    audit_directory(directory)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This module provides a single function `audit_directory` for auditing files, and a `main` function that serves as the entry point for the module. The `main` function will audit the current working directory by default, or a different directory if provided as a command line argument. The `audit_directory` function audits all files in the given directory by printing the name of each file and its size in bytes to the console. If the directory does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` will be raised.

Note: This is a very basic implementation of a file auditing module, and could be extended to provide more advanced functionality such as auditing permissions, file types, and other file metadata.
