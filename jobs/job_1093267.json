Despite being the 7th largest market for life insurance in the OECD, Italy ranks only 25th in property and casualty premiums relative to GDP. This underinsurance, coupled with a slow-moving, broker-dominated market, creates a significant opening for innovation. With 77% of Italian consumers expressing high interest in purchasing more policies digitally in the future, and the insurance industry poised to be the second-most impacted by generative AI, the timing is perfect for a disruptive entrant to capture market share.</p><p><strong><br /><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tetto Assicurazione: A new kind of home contents insurance for a new generation</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tetto Assicurazione aims to revolutionise the Italian insurance market with a mobile-first, AI-powered home and contents insurance subscription service. Targeting young, urban renters, our platform will leverage large language models and multimodal AI to provide instant quotes, personalised coverage, and near-instant claim payouts.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p dir=\"ltr\">By syncing with customers' digital lives, Tetto will automatically adjust coverage as circumstances change, ensuring users are always adequately protected without overpaying. This tech-forward approach, combined with transparent pricing and a user-friendly interface, positions Tetto to become the go-to insurance provider for Italy's next generation of consumers.</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">As part of the founding team you will be an instrumental part of shaping the product &amp; business strategy and will have direct industry experience in financial or insurance data.
