The rapid growth of AI is worsening this problem, as the purview of the modern manager expands. While many organizations respond to these challenges with internal training programs, these are frequently relegated to already overwhelmed HR leaders, who are taught to prioritize compliance and administration rather than genuinely improving team clarity, cohesion, and performance.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">We see middle managers differently: they are the heartbeat of company culture and the driving force behind team results. At Leadr, we build AI-powered software tools that improve quality of life for those managers, while coaching them toward better leadership and outcomes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 paired with hands-on training for these leaders to teach them the most critical skills overlooked by companies.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">When you join Leadr, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committing to help us tackle this important and rewarding challenge: transforming how people lead.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Your Role:</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Leadr is seeking an entrepreneurial, results-driven Account Executive to help us take Leadr to the next level of growth.
